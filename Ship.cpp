/*
Define the destructor function even if it was declared as a pure virtual function.
This seems odd, because pure virtual functions are usually not defined in the class
that declares them. But this is often done as a way to make a class abstract, 
if there is no other virtual function that makes sense to mark as pure. Here we
are defining it just to get the destructor message output.

/*
Calculate the new position of a ship based on how it is moving, its speed, and
fuel state. This function should be called only if the state is 
moving_to_position, moving_to_island, or moving_on_course.

Track_base has an update_position(double time) function that computes the new position
of an object after the specified time has elapsed. If the ship is going to move
for a full time unit (one hour), then it will get go the "full step" distance,
so update_position would be called with time = 1.0. If we can move less than that,
e.g. due to not enough fuel, update position  will be called with the corresponding
time less than 1.0.

For clarity in specifying the computation, this code assumes the specified private variable names, 
but you may change the variable names or enum class names, or state names if you wish (e.g. movement_state).
